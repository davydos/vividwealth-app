## Current Tasks
1. ✅ Repository created at https://github.com/davydos/vividwealth-app
2. ✅ Local code pushed to GitHub repository (main, develop, feature/auth-flow, hotfix/splash-screen)
3. ⏳ Configure branch protection rules in GitHub settings (manual step required)
4. ⏳ Set up required secrets (EXPO_TOKEN, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, CODECOV_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN) (manual step required)
5. ✅ Created custom labels for issue tracking (ui/ux, dependencies, ci/cd, mobile-only)
6. ✅ Created issue for fixing type declarations

## Next Steps After GitHub Integration
1. Complete manual GitHub setup steps:
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Add repository secrets
   - Create GitHub Project board (instructions provided)
2. Fix type declaration issues (Issue #1)
3. Validate CI/CD workflows are running correctly
4. Create first feature branch for development
5. Implement user feedback system
6. Begin beta testing preparation

## Recent Activity
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/davydos/vividwealth-app
- Pushed main, develop, feature/auth-flow, and hotfix/splash-screen branches
- Created CODEOWNERS file to define code ownership
- Fixed issues with the CodeQL setup in the CI workflow
- Added comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and rollback
- Standardized Expo GitHub Action version across all workflows
- Added custom labels for better issue tracking
- Created issue #1 to address missing type declarations
- Updated GitHub repository references in README.md
- Added .gitignore with appropriate exclusions

## Blockers
- Need organization "vividwealth" to be created (temporarily using personal account)
- Branch protection rules need to be set up manually via GitHub web interface
- Repository secrets need to be configured manually via GitHub web interface

## Recommendations
1. Create GitHub organization "vividwealth" and transfer the repository
2. Complete the manual branch protection setup for main and develop branches
3. Configure required secrets for CI/CD workflows to function properly
4. Complete setup of GitHub Project board for task tracking
5. Validate CI workflow on first pull request
6. Implement required type declarations for React, React Native, and other libraries to fix linter errors

## Known Issues
- Need to verify EAS build process with real Expo tokens
- Type declaration dependencies are missing for React, React Native, NativeWind, and React Native Reanimated (tracked in issue #1)

## Pending Approvals
- None at this time
