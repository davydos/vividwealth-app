3. Push all branches using `git push org-origin --all`
4. Copy all secrets using GitHub CLI commands:
   ```
   gh secret set EXPO_TOKEN --body "<your-expo-token>" --repo vividwealth/vividwealth-app
   gh secret set EXPO_USERNAME --body "<your-expo-username>" --repo vividwealth/vividwealth-app
   gh secret set EXPO_PASSWORD --body "<your-expo-password>" --repo vividwealth/vividwealth-app
   gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --body "<your-codecov-token>" --repo vividwealth/vividwealth-app
   ```

## Phase Completion

- [ ] First production release

## Current Tasks
1. ✅ Repository created at https://github.com/davydos/vividwealth-app
2. ✅ Local code pushed to GitHub repository (main, develop, feature/auth-flow, hotfix/splash-screen)
3. ✅ Configure branch protection rules in GitHub settings (completed)
4. ✅ Set up required secrets (CODECOV_TOKEN, EXPO_TOKEN, EXPO_USERNAME, EXPO_PASSWORD) (completed for davydos/vividwealth-app)
5. ✅ Created custom labels for issue tracking (ui/ux, dependencies, ci/cd, mobile-only)
6. ✅ Created issue for fixing type declarations
7. ✅ Added EXPO_USERNAME and EXPO_PASSWORD secrets and updated CI workflow (commit: [date: 2025-04-17])
8. ✅ Added remote for organization repository (org-origin)
9. ❌ Migrate to organization repository (pending organization creation)
10. ❌ Fix Expo authentication issues (incorrect format or invalid credentials)
11. ✅ Removed Slack notification from CI workflow (commit: [date: 2025-04-17])

## Repository Secrets Audit
**Date:** 2025-04-17

**Required Secrets (from CI workflow):**
1. CODECOV_TOKEN - For uploading test coverage
2. EXPO_TOKEN - For Expo CLI authentication
3. EXPO_USERNAME - For Expo login
4. EXPO_PASSWORD - For Expo login

**Current Repository Secrets (davydos/vividwealth-app):**
- ✅ CODECOV_TOKEN
- ❌ EXPO_TOKEN (present but invalid or incorrectly formatted)
- ❌ EXPO_USERNAME (present but may be invalid)
- ❌ EXPO_PASSWORD (present but may be invalid)
- ⚠️ SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (no longer required, can be removed)

**Organization Repository Secrets (vividwealth/vividwealth-app):**
- ❌ No secrets configured (repository doesn't exist)

**Secret Status:**
- Expo authentication is consistently failing with a 401 error
- EXPO_TOKEN is likely the primary issue as it fails during the validation step

## Next Steps After GitHub Integration
1. ✅ Complete manual GitHub setup steps:
   - ✅ Set up branch protection rules
   - ✅ Add repository secrets
   - Create GitHub Project board (instructions provided)
2. Fix type declaration issues (Issue #1)
3. Validate CI/CD workflows are running correctly
4. Create first feature branch for development
5. Implement user feedback system
6. Begin beta testing preparation

## Recent Activity
- Added repository secrets: EXPO_TOKEN, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, CODECOV_TOKEN, and GITHUB_TOKEN
- Set up branch protection rules for main and develop branches requiring:
  - Pull request reviews before merging
  - At least one approval
  - Passing CI checks before merging
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/davydos/vividwealth-app
- Pushed main, develop, feature/auth-flow, and hotfix/splash-screen branches
- Created CODEOWNERS file to define code ownership
- Fixed issues with the CodeQL setup in the CI workflow
- Added comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and rollback
- Standardized Expo GitHub Action version across all workflows
- Added custom labels for better issue tracking
- Created issue #1 to address missing type declarations
- Updated GitHub repository references in README.md
- Added .gitignore with appropriate exclusions
- Updated CI workflow with proper Expo authentication steps
- Added remote for future organization repository (org-origin)
- Added all required GitHub secrets but issue with Expo credentials persists
- Removed Slack notification step from CI workflow to simplify debugging
- Reran the CI workflow after removing Slack notifications (401 error persists)

## Blockers
- Need organization "vividwealth" to be created (temporarily using personal account)
- ~Branch protection rules need to be set up manually via GitHub web interface~ (Completed)
- Repository secrets need to be configured manually via GitHub web interface (Completed for davydos/vividwealth-app)
- All required secrets are missing from the organization repository (pending repository creation)
- Expo authentication failing with 401 error (invalid credentials or token format)

## Recommendations
1. Create GitHub organization "vividwealth" and transfer the repository
2. ~Complete the manual branch protection setup for main and develop branches~ (Completed)
3. Fix Expo authentication issues:
   - Verify EXPO_TOKEN format (should be a valid Expo token)
   - Regenerate a new EXPO_TOKEN from the Expo developer dashboard
   - Check that EXPO_USERNAME and EXPO_PASSWORD match the account that generated the token
   - Consider temporarily using a personal access token for CI instead of username/password
4. Remove SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL secret as it's no longer needed
5. Complete setup of GitHub Project board for task tracking
6. After fixing authentication issues, rerun the CI workflow to validate
7. Implement required type declarations for React, React Native, and other libraries to fix linter errors

## Known Issues
- Expo authentication failing with 401 error (unauthorized)
- Type declaration dependencies are missing for React, React Native, NativeWind, and React Native Reanimated (tracked in issue #1)
- Legacy Expo CLI warnings about Node +17 support (should be migrated to newer Expo CLI)

## Pending Approvals
- None at this time
